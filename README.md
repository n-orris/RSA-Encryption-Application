# **ULock**

## Project Proposal

## The application will

 
Provide Encryption/Decryption and storage of secure messages, files, and keys.
Utilizing the Java Cryptography architecture (JCA) and several external libraries users will be able to:


- Generate public/private key pairs
- Encrypt messages using public keys
- Decrypt messages using private keys
- store encrypted messages/files

### Who will use it?
This application will be useful for anyone dealing with confidential information. It will allow for storage and 
encryption services that can be done offline and stored on the physical computer to limit threat of network based breaches. 
Simple UX and help section will allow for individuals without Cybersecurity knowledge to make use of this application.   

### Interest

This project is of interest to me because I am currently work on the business side of a Cybersecurity company and have
been interested in the subject since a young age. I have previous technical experience through Capture the flag style 
CyberSec hackathons and choose this project as a way to expand my technical knowledge of the subject. I would like to
a good understanding of the implementation of encryption in everyday software.
